# Segmentation of Cell Images Using Machine Learning (Support-Vector-Machine)

In this repository the detailed process of an implementation of a support-vector-machine can be found. 
This includes the support-vector-machine itself, the Dice Score to evaluate its performance and our data, which consists of cell images and synthetic images. 
The code creating the synthetic images, while enlarging our training-set, is also deposited here.
Additionally our unit-test can also be found in this repository.

In the directory SVM_Segmentation the final python modules can be found.
