# Dice Score

# Synthetic images
## Mixing object over real world scenes
--> probably not as useful for our case as cells are usually in front of dark background, but still an option to evaluate --> will the Dice Score get better with that method?

## domain transfer/randomization
as size, lighting etc. of objects change, this can be simulated with domain transfer (Unity or Blender)
--> probably more useful, as we have changes in size, dividing or leaving cells etc


# Support Vector Machine

1. Tensorflow --> an Option?
