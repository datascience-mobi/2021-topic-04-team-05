# Meeting Notes
**07.07.2021**

---

## Last week's progress
- Debugging SVM
- Report on Pre-processing, Synthetic Images, SGD, Cross-validation, Pipeline
- Pre-processing: Watershed & Gauss
- Make the PowerPoint for Final Presentation

## Questions
- SVM: separation into N-dimensional array, but doesn't allow us to call its shape
- PCA: the fact that the amount of pixels stays the same although the images have been transformed...?
- Report:
  We didn't really understand what about Carl sent us in his email : The code chunks shouldn't be shown because there are no enough room
  Just the most important code chunks should be shown in pdf. The Markdown/Jupyter already contain all code chunks
  --> run the top function and then the descriptive statistics for different dice scores (boxplots, swarmplot)


## Plans for next week
- Analysis
- Finalize the Report with our Results especially the comparisons (pre-processing methods & preparation methods)
