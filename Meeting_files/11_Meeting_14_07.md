## Last week's progress
- Debugging the SVM
- Finishing Report

## Questions
- About Conda environment export
  Submodul for preprocessing & preparation
  All should be written small (no capslock) except class number
  
- Count the cells instead of cancer grading, references introduction
- Not 'Our Dataset' but just 'Dataset'
  
- Just write 1 abbreviation, the rest should be written with that

- Show difference on images in our data

- Mathematical background: no star for multiplication! 
  
- Correct the PCA in report, no intergral projection and read the text again

- Presentation: adapt the with minmaxscaler the range of images values

- Is our repository already OK? (everything in SVM_Segmentation)

## Plans for next week
- Analysis
  
- finalize Report with our Results esp. the comparisons (pre-processing methods & preparation methods)
