## Last week's progress
- 

## Questions
- At Pre-Processing: should we also use High-Pass Filter that enhance the edges? (It's also our goal, but would it be another filter that distorts the images?)
- Dice Score: about Differentiation and Loss of Function
- Our Dataset -> Ground Truth, Abbreviations, Coloration
- How much math is necessary in SVM?

## Plans for next week
- Finish up the presentation (with the feedback)
- Practice it
