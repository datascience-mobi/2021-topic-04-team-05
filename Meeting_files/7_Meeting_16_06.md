# Meeting Notes
**16.06.2021**

---

## Last week's progress
- preparing data for SVM: finishing PCA
- research on SVM work flow
- report on SVM (general info & math)

## Questions
- *discuss about SVM workflow  *
- Grayscale at ground truth: How could we implement in our SVM/Dice Score? Should we generate the segmented cells
not just white, but also with different colors? Because keeping it doesn't really help us anymore for the dice score
- Present our code -> Recommendation for improvement?
- Mathematical Background for PCA in report?

## Plans for next week
- start SVM
- finish report about SVM
- implement tiles
