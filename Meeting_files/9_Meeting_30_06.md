# Meeting Notes
**30.06.2021**

---

## Last week's progress
- SVM Code
- Reading images into dataframes, normalization, thresholding
- Finalizing code (PCA) & adding comments

## Questions
- About unit tests
  --> for dice score: smaller array, calculate per hand and observe whether the values match
  --> compare the SVM with SVC
- Preprocessing & preparation are just for the training set or also for the test set?
  --> for both, because that gives us advantages and influence the SVM

## Plans for next week
- analysis & report
