    "Needed for its calculation are the segmented image as well as a corresponding binary reference point also called\n",

    "As ground truth image researchers mostly use the segmentation result of humans. We will use the ground truth images\n",
    "provided with our data sets, which we suspect to be acquired by this method.\n",
    "Using the ground truth image, it is possible to assign the labels true positive (TP), false positive (FP) and false\n",
    "negative (FN) to each pixel of the segmented image.\n",
    "This information is then used to calculate the dice coefficient using formula (1):\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) dice = ${\\frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}}$\n",
    "*ich habe keine ahnung wie ich das als formel implementieren kann*\n",
    "\n",
    "The dice is element of [0,1]. 0 indicates that the ground truth and the segmentation result do not overlap. 1 on the\n",
    "other hand shows a 100% overlap of ground truth and segmented image.\n",
